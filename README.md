# Tetris using C++ and raylib
This GitHub repository is home to the code for a Tetris game built with C++ and the raylib library. The game uses various raylib functions for graphics, input handling, and audio and can be played on Windows, macOS, and Linux computers. This program gave me the chance to become stronger with OOP concepts and how to set up a game window, create the Grid and block classes, add collision detection, and implement sound effects in raylib.

# Usage
1. Double click on the main.code-workspace file. This will open the game in VS Code.
2. From the Explorer Window of VS Code navigate to the src folder and double click on the main.cpp file.
3. Press F5 on the keyboard to compile and run the program.
